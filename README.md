# Workoutroulette
If you have hard time deciding what to do, let roulette decide... 100xrep sets of squats will be fun

This app i made for fun, idea is pretty simple.
You roll roulette and get movement, then you get ammount of reps you do that, 
and if you want ammount of sets you do that.

Lets make one thing clear: DONT MAKE SERIOUS WORKOUTS BASED ON THIS! 
This is just for having fun sometimes.
